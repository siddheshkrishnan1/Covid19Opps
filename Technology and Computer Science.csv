Project Title,Source,Project Description
Validation of specimen self-collection vs. collection by health care worker for COVID-19 testing,Stanford,"Maldonado, Altamirano, Govindarajan and Blomkalns are investigating three swab techniques used during COVID-19 testing: a self-collected nasal swab performed with the aid of an instruction sheet; a health care worker-collected nasal swab; and a health care worker-collected oropharyngeal swab. Should self-collected nasal swabs prove as effective as those collected by health care workers, patients may be able to safely and effectively collect specimens outside of health care settings."
Lung function in people infected with SARS-CoV-2,Stanford,"Milla and his team are evaluating whether improvements they’ve made in a lung function test can more successfully and safely identify subjects at high risk of severe COVID-19 disease, even when disease is in its early, asymptomatic stage. Standard tests involve inhaling deeply and quickly exhaling as much air as possible. The Milla lab’s improvements allow subjects to simply breathe passively for a few seconds through a mouthpiece. This not only makes the test feasible for sick subjects but also minimizes the generation of aerosols. "
Tracking COVID-19 with wearables,Stanford,Snyder and his team will track biological parameters of individuals who are ill with COVID-19 or at risk for the disease using a smart watch. Their goal is to determine whether they can tell if the smart watch user is becoming ill based on measurements such as heart rate.
Repurposing snorkel masks for personal protective equipment,Stanford,"Prakash and his lab are repurposing full-face snorkel masks as reusable personal protective equipment for healthcare workers to help combat the shortage of personal protective equipment in hospitals. To ensure protection against airborne pathogens, the group is 3D-printing N95 filter attachments that are fitted to the snorkel masks. The prototypes are currently being tested in the three clinics currently."
Novel aerosol capture tools for understanding COVID-19 infectiousness,Stanford,"Andrews’ group is developing and validating tools to capture airborne biological particles and characterize infectiousness, with the goals of understanding predictors and determinants of infectiousness and potentially monitoring environments for presence of SARS-CoV-2."
Clinical trial of remdesivir in hospitalized adults with COVID-19,Stanford,"Nadeau and Ahuja are conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Ebola drug remdesivir in hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and is a multicenter trial that will be conducted at as many as 50 sites globally."
Clinical trial of novel therapeutic for mild COVID-19 infection to prevent severe disease and reduce viral shedding,Stanford,"Singh’s team is conducting a trial of a novel therapeutic called Lambda, a broad-spectrum anti-viral compound that’s been given to more than 3,000 patients in clinical trials of hepatitis viruses, for efficacy in outpatients with mild COVID-19. In vitro and animal-model data suggest Lambda may also inhibit replication of respiratory viruses, such as the COVID-19 virus. The team plans to perform a phase 2 randomized controlled trial of Lambda among outpatients with mild COVID-19 to determine whether the drug reduces the duration of symptoms, viral shedding and the risk of hospitalization."
Develop proofs-of-concept for two novel COVID-19 drugs to begin clinical trials,Stanford,"Glenn is preparing two potential COVID-19 drugs for clinical trials: a lipid kinase inhibitor that could be used to combat COVID-19 and other viruses, and a locked nucleic acid, similar to one that he has successfully developed to target every known strain of the flu and that could potentially be used during any flu pandemic. Both of these drugs could treat multiple viruses and strains, have high barriers to resistance, and, in some cases, could be used in nonviral applications."
Using artificial intelligence to predict drugs that may inhibit COVID-19,Stanford,"Altman and his group have used artificial intelligence to computationally predict six drugs that could inhibit TMPRSS2, a protein that plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Altman and his collaborators outside of Stanford Medicine plan to conduct experimental follow-up studies to explore the efficacy of two of the drugs in blocking SARS-CoV-2 from causing infection. While promising, the potential drugs are still part of a preliminary computational analysis and would be dangerous to use clinically at this time."
Genomic surveillance to identify silent transmission clusters of COVID-19,Stanford,Andrews’ team is developing and testing novel tools that utilize microbial whole-genome sequences to identify chains of transmission between individuals. Andrews proposes to work with local hospitals and the state and county health departments to perform whole-genome sequencing on all COVID-19-positive samples and apply these methods in real-time to characterize transmission chains and help guide public health investigations.
Determining pathogenicity of various variants and strains of COVID-19,Stanford,"Snyder and his group plan to track different variants and strains of COVID-19 and quantitatively determine which ones correlate with different phenotypes, such as levels of pathogenicity. His team also plans to study the false negative rate of COVID-19, seeking to better understand how many people receive a false negative test result during early stages of the disease."
COVID-19 and Stanford WELL for Life study to understand the effects of shelter-in-place on well-being,Stanford,"Hsing and the Stanford WELL for Life team are investigating the effect of COVID-19 and the shelter-in-place order on well-being. They are surveying existing Stanford WELL for Life participants (about 5,000) with the WELL questionnaire, which measures distress and multiple dimensions of well-being longitudinally at six time points over the next 12 months. This approach will enable the evaluation of the short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 quarantine and social distancing on emotions, social connectedness and physical health."
Investigation of possible oral-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Bay Area,Stanford,"The Bhatt group and collaborators are investigating whether SARS-CoV-2 was circulating through oral-fecal cycles in the Bay Area community. The lab plans to screen stool samples collected through a biobank at Stanford for signs of SARS-CoV-2 from December 2019 through December 2020. Depending on sample availability, the team also plans to research whether a patient’s gut microbiome composition affects gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19, as well as other details about how the virus sheds."
Model for hospital bed and resource use projections,Stanford,"Scheinker’s team has developed two interactive models that are available online to the public. One helps project bed and resource capacity, and the other helps  project the number of hospitalizations countywide."
Modeling outcomes of COVID-19 patients,Stanford,"Hernandez-Boussard and Desai plan to use data from patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at Stanford Health Care to investigate how disease burden varies significantly in patients infected with the virus. Currently, the association of co-infections, symptomatology, comorbidities and other parameters on patient trajectories is unknown."
"School closures, health care worker absenteeism, and child care subsidies",Stanford,"School closures help reduce peak hospital bed demand, but they can unintentionally cause health care worker absenteeism for those with children. Huynh and Chin are examining the economic feasibility of child care subsidies, as well as the policy effects of child care interventions on absenteeism at Stanford Health Care."
COVID-19 patients presenting in impending respiratory failure from ambulatory settings,Stanford,Carmichael and Asch are investigating the connection between unusual symptoms of COVID-19 and the frequency that those cases become ambulatory patients with severe respiratory failure or impending severe respiratory failure. Their objective is to describe clinical factors that may identify people with COVID-19 predisposed to severe respiratory failure outside the hospital.
Systems biological “multi-omics” analysis of immunity to COVID-19 infection,Stanford,Pulendran is investigating the interaction between the human immune system and the SARS-CoV-2 virus through systems-biological methods. His group will use a “multi-omics” approach to probe the host immune system response to SARS-CoV-2 during asymptomatic and symptomatic phases of infection. Their goal is to determine why some people get more severe symptoms than others and to identify biomarkers that predict disease severity in vulnerable populations. His group will also study the immune mechanisms by which vaccines confer protection against SARS-CoV-2.
Deep omics profiling to determine the genomic factors at play in disease severity,Stanford,"Ashley, Parikh and their team are sequencing genomic information from SARS-CoV-2 and human hosts to better understand the diversity of host responses to the virus. Their work aims to better elucidate genomic details underlying COVID-19 disease severity. To do so, the team will collect de-identified omic and clinical data for 1,000 Stanford patients who tested positive for COVID-19-, including hospitalized patients and patients who were in the intensive care unit."
Role of antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease ,Stanford,"Wang and her group are studying molecules that correlate with immunity against COVID-19.

The overarching goal of this work is to guide the development of vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2."
Comparative pathology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 infections in humans and animal models,Stanford,Nolan and his team are applying multiplexed technologies to achieve in-depth profiling of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in nonclinical and clinical studies. Their goal is to identify immune markers associated with outcomes for COVID-19 and understand the arrangement of immune cells relative to lung tissue cells during infection.
The Apollo study,Stanford,"Bondy, Nelson and Goodman have launched a national survey that aims to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the population physically, socially, emotionally and financially. The team’s survey is hosted by an app, called Apollo, that’s designed to screen patients at drive-through COVID-19 testing sites."
Caregiver survey COVID-19,Stanford,"Trivedi and her team are conducting an anonymous online survey to better understand the experiences of informal caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Informal caregivers are family members or friends who provide significant help to people with mental or physical health conditions. Trivedi aims to use the results of the survey to guide advocacy efforts in support of informal caregivers. A link to the approximately 20-minute survey, which can be taken from anywhere in the world, is available at https://is.gd/stanfordcaregiverstudy."
