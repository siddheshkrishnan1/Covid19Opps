Project Title,Source,Project Description
Development of rapid at-home testing for COVID-19,Stanford,"Greenleaf is leading an effort to develop new methods of COVID-19 detection at the point of care to help get around current supply chain problems and allow for rapid screening. The kit in development is meant to function directly in sample swabs and, in principle, could be done at home or in decentralized clinics if users were taught proper swabbing techniques."
Phase 3 clinical trials of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with moderate and severe COVID-19,Stanford,"Subramanian and Grant have been conducting two multicenter, randomized, phase 3 clinical trials of an anti-viral medication, remdesivir. They are following patients to see how quickly they improve to the point of no longer needing oxygen or hospitalization. These trials, supported by Gilead Sciences, are being conducted at 100 centers worldwide. Stanford Medicine has been enrolling patients since March 14."
Rapid-response ventilators,Stanford,"Camarillo and Van Wert have undertaken a project to design and build simplified, rapidly scalable, single-use ventilators to help address the broad shortage of ventilators nationwide. The team aims to create machines that hospitals can use to save lives when standard ventilators are unavailable. The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub is supporting this work. "
Defining the therapeutic potential of host-targeted approaches for combating COVID-19,Stanford,"Einav’s lab is researching repurposed and novel anti-viral approaches targeting two cellular kinases that are an Achilles' heel of multiple unrelated RNA viruses. Their data show that a combination of two already-approved anti-cancer drugs that act against these kinases inhibits replication of multiple viruses in vitro and reduces mortality in mice infected with the dengue or Ebola viruses. The lab has also been developing more selective compounds that target these cellular kinases and have potent activity against multiple RNA viruses, including flaviviruses and coronaviruses, both in vitro and in human primary cells."
Coronavirus antiviral research database,Stanford,"Shafer’s team has created an online database of compounds with proven or potential anti-COVID-19 activity. The compounds include targeted anti-virals, repurposed drugs, investigational agents and other compounds that inhibit virus replication. The data come from published biochemical, cellular, small animal, nonhuman primate and human clinical studies. The goal of the database is to provide a uniform way to report experimental results, enabling comparisons between different compounds and allowing prioritization for further development."
Crowdsourcing solutions to better understand molecular structures of COVID-19,Stanford,"The Chang and Das labs are engaging participants of the online-gaming platform Eterna to understand how the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 virus might change during the pandemic. Eterna educates and enables its players to “be the virus,” simulating how it shifts its sequence over time to evade diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines being developed to fight COVID-19. The project seeks to provide RNA-structure-informed predictions and analyses that are not available through other computational efforts, while engaging and educating millions of citizens worldwide through compelling puzzles."
Stanford Medicine National Daily Health Survey for Coronavirus ,Stanford,"Hofmann is leading an effort to track COVID-19 symptoms nationally using self-reported data from a daily, digital survey. The goal is to create a novel coronavirus heat map that can be used to target and inform national efforts and public health interventions. The creation of this data set is dependent on participation across Stanford Medicine and our broader communities."
Building a Bay Area SARS-CoV-2 information commons,Stanford,"Shah and Maldonado are hoping to better anticipate the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing predictions of the pandemic are uncertain due to many factors, such as a lack of plentiful and optimal data and the fact that models vary depending on the location. The scientists are creating a platform that combines diverse inputs to quantify the effects of the shelter-in-place order. The goal is to create more accurate, higher-resolution models about COVID-19 pandemic parameters."
Continuous symptom profiling of patients screened for SARS-CoV-2,Stanford,"Shah’s team is analyzing medical notes describing symptoms of patients screened and tested for SARS-CoV-2 at Stanford Medicine. They want to determine if combinations of symptoms are predictive of SARS-CoV-2 test results to assist screening in low-resource settings. They also hope to use information from the medical notes — such as symptoms, duration of disease, travel history and more — to anticipate which patients will require admission or eventual ICU care."
Bed- and resource-use projections for Stanford Health Care,Stanford,Staudenmayer and Schulman have developed an operational Stanford Health Care model to match projected COVID-19 admissions against hospital resources. Their model can be found here.
The Stanford-CIDE novel coronavirus simulation model,Stanford,"A group of faculty members at Stanford Health Policy, including Joshua Salomon and David Studdert, as well as graduate and medical students, are working with Fernando Alarid-Escudero and his group at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics, in Mexico, to provide high-quality modeling of the epidemiology of COVID-19. Their work encompasses diverse populations and geographies, including California, Mexico and India. The model incorporates realistic demography and patterns of contacts and disease transmissions, as well as nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing."
Predicting best strategies for scarce resource allocation during COVID-19 pandemic,Stanford,"Hernandez-Boussard and Desai will use data that shows the time of hospital admission up to the time of mechanical ventilation to predict patient recovery, details of hospital discharge and survival at 24 hours, 7 days, and later. This model will include important factors for COVID-19 recovery and will be continuously updated in real-time as emerging data become available. In the event of resource scarcity, this effort has the potential to inform optimal resource allocation at Stanford Health care."
COVID-19 imaging utilization per patient admission,Stanford,Lungren and his team are building a dashboard for real-time visualization of COVID-19 radiological imaging at Stanford Hospital. The tool will aid the hospital’s resource planning by forecasting the impact of incoming patients on bed use and by predicting expected radiological image use. The team will create a web-based dashboard that will be implemented at Stanford Hospital for better radiological resource management.
Inflammatory bowel disease treatment in the time of COVID: Patient perceptions and decision-making ,Stanford,"Kin and Streett are exploring how people with inflammatory bowel diseases, including people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis whose treatment frequently involves chronic immunosuppressive therapies, are affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The study aims to understand the primary concerns that patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have about their illnesses and treatments as they relate to the COVID-19 epidemic so that physicians and the health care team can effectively engage them in shared decision-making."
Optimized remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic,Stanford,"Paredes and collaborators are creating digital tools to support and maintain productivity levels while managing stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and long-term telecommuting. The researchers propose a collection of tools, dubbed “Home Sweet Office,” that can support personal productivity by managing procrastination caused by online behaviors, such as overuse of social media, and provide stress-management tactics and emotion-regulation interventions."
Rates of co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens,Stanford,"The scientists published a research letter that reports on how often patients infected with the coronavirus in Northern California are co-infected with other respiratory pathogens. Results of their analysis suggest higher rates of co-infection than previously reported, with no significant difference in rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with and without other pathogens. The study indicates that the presence of a non–SARS-CoV-2 pathogen does not provide reassurance that a patient isn’t also infected with SARS-CoV-2."
