Project Title,Source,Project Description
Building COVID-19 testing capacity both locally and nationally,Stanford,"Pinsky’s team is focused on building COVID-19 testing capacity, both locally and nationally. They are collaborating with other clinical laboratories to ensure these labs can meet the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 clinical testing. The group is also working with various collaborators to develop and evaluate novel methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as methods to assess immune protection and to predict the severity of disease."
Machine-learning-based evaluation for COVID-19,Stanford,"Banaei’s group is using machine learning to develop a web tool that uses non-SARS-CoV-2 test results (such as blood cell counts and other available tests) to rule out COVID-19 infection with high accuracy. The goal is to provide health care workers another, possibly faster, option for screening individuals for COVID-19."
Natural history of shedding and household transmission of COVID-19: Constructing patterns of viral spread and evolution,Stanford,"Maldonado’s team will combine genomic and epidemiologic data to address questions about the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of COVID-19. Her team plans to use whole-genome sequencing to understand how COVID-19 mutates during the early stages of infection, as well as generate a bio-repository of specimens and associated clinical and epidemiologic data for use in understanding the transmission of COVID-19. "
Specimen collection during COVID-19 clinical trials and lab biosafety enhancements,Stanford,"Subramanian and Grant are co-principal investigators of a Gilead-sponsored clinical trial that evaluates the safety and efficacy of using the Ebola drug remdesivir to treat patients with COVID-19. In parallel with these trials, Blish wants to collect specimens, such as blood and stool samples, and later expand collection to individuals outside of the trials. These bio-specimens will be crucial in understanding the biological underpinnings of this virus."
Stanford Coronavirus Study to understand behavioral and societal impacts,Stanford,"Linos and her team are developing a website with reliable public health information about COVID-19 and surveys about the social and behavioral impact of the evolving pandemic. They also plan to share survey results to directly inform public health practitioners, health care systems, clinicians and policymakers about the informational, social and health needs of community members in their regions."
Utilizing radiological imaging of COVID-19 patients for allocation of hospital resources,Stanford,"Lungren and his collaborators are using machine learning to analyze CT scans, X-rays and clinical data of COVID-positive patients to predict the risk of respiratory failure or the need for supportive treatment. Their goal is to help direct the allocation of hospital resources, including decision-making on admission and use of intensive care resources."
Analysis of COVID-19 CT scans and X-rays for classification and prediction of patient outcomes,Stanford,"Lungren and his collaborators are using imaging and clinical data to predict the risk of respiratory failure, mortality and length of hospital admission among patients with COVID-19. In addition, they aim to quantify CT scans of COVID 19 patients and auto-generate medical reports and correlate the scans to clinical outcomes, such as infection. "
Answering COVID-19 clinical research questions with electronic health record data,Stanford,"Chang and Lu and their collaborators are collecting clinical questions related to COVID-19 that can be addressed through observational electronic health record data. The group is investigating connections between the disease and low levels of lymphocytes, lower cholesterol and abnormal chest X-rays. If you would like to submit a question, please do so here. A list of questions that have been submitted can be found here. Student submissions can be found here. For questions, please contact sm_covid_query@lists.stanford.edu."
Using human organoids to understand COVID-19 infection ,Stanford,"Kuo, Amieva and Blish are recreating the SARS-CoV-2 infection in three-dimensional human mini-organs, or “organoids.” SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. Kuo and Amieva are investigating details behind how the virus infects human lung and intestinal tissues through organoid models, and Blish is studying the response of individual cells infected with SARS-CoV-2."
Multi-omics assessment of individuals infected with COVID-19,Stanford,"The Snyder group will collect biological samples from individuals ill with COVID-19 and those most at risk for the disease, observing and assessing levels of certain molecules involved in several biological pathways, including metabolism and immune function. The team will use this information to create “omics” profiles to look for potential molecular signatures of COVID-19 infection, as well as signs that an individual might have a strong adverse reaction to the virus."
Analysis of immune response to coronavirus via genomics,Stanford,"Chang, Pinksy Boyd and Satpathy are collaborating with the company 10x Genomics to study the immune response to the coronavirus through single-cell genomics and clinical assays. The team will track immune responses in about 100 patients with COVID-19, performing in-depth molecular analyses of cells and blood samples."
SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiovascular complications,Stanford,Wu and Nguyen are researching cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. The scientists are addressing the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection in heart muscle and vascular cells and the consequences of taking common drugs for high blood pressure. Their research employs muscle and vascular cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells to determine how these blood pressure drugs affect the virus’ ability to enter cells. 
Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Availability of Administrative Supplements and Revision Supplements on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),Virginia Tech,"Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis through October 05, 2020
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is encouraging the submission of applications for either Administrative Supplements (PA-18-591) or Competitive Revisions (PA-18-935) to active grants to address research on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and on biological effects of its causative agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Topics of specific interest to NHLBI include host response, associations with heart, lung, and blood (HLB) diseases, potential impacts on transfusion safety, and clinical outcomes of infected individuals."
NSF-BSF COVID-19 Rapid Submission,Virginia Tech,"These programs have no deadline; applications are welcomed until further notice. Israeli PIs must submit their proposal to the BSF within seven days after the U.S. PI submits to the NSF.
Call for Proposals in Joint NSF-BSF Programs Dealing with the Coronavirus Disease. The U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) is accepting applications dealing with the Coronavirus Disease in all the active NSF-BSF programs."
