Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),,"As part of the COVID-19 Supplemental Appropriation for the CARES Act of 2020, Congress appropriated 1 million dollars for FHIP. The purpose of this Notice is to seek applications from eligible entities that will create and disseminate fair housing education and outreach materials in COVID-19 affected areas. During this national emergency, HUD wants to remind housing providers and the public of important federal fair housing laws that protect persons from discrimination, including harassment and intimidation in housing and related services on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status and disability. HUD is already aware that persons with disabilities, including those who are older and have underlying medical conditions, are vulnerable and at high risk for a severe, life-threatening response to COVID-19. HUD recognizes that these persons may face unique fair housing and civil rights issues in their fair housing related services. Housing providers are required to make reasonable accommodations that may be necessary to deliver housing and services to persons with disabilities affecting major life activities. In addition, HUD wants to prevent discrimination and harassment against people of who, because of racial profiling, are perceived to be associated with this disease. Historically, the number of fair housing complaints increases in the aftermath of a disaster or emergency. Essential to control the number of Fair Housing Act violations during this critical time, is the provision of widespread, highly visible outreach and education activities regarding the Fair Housing Act requirements.",https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=327577,Other

The NIH Director's Early Independence Award (a component of the High-Risk, High-Reward Research program of the NIH Common Fund) provides an opportunity for exceptional junior scientists to accelerate their entry into an independent research career by forgoing the traditional post-doctoral training period. Though most newly graduated doctoral-level researchers would benefit from post-doctoral training, a small number of outstanding junior investigators are capable of launching directly into an independent research career. For those select junior investigators who have already established a record of scientific innovation and research productivity and have demonstrated unusual scientific vision and maturity, typical post-doctoral training would unnecessarily delay their entry into independent research.
