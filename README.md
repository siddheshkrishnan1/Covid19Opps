# Covid-19 Opportunities

### With the Covid-19 pandemic, most students have been forced to abandon their college campuses and return home for a mandatory quarentine. However, while sitting at home, they have been given an ample amount of time to work on any project of their choosing. With such a big pandemic going around, it almost seems impossible to discover ways to help out with any research efforts. However, this tool helps link students with research opportunites where they can help out in efforts related to alleviating issues caused by the pandemic.
