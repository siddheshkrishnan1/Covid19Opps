Rapid-Response Grants on Covid-19 and the Social Sciences,Social Sciences,"The SSRC’s Covid-19 Rapid-Response Grants thus support innovative research projects that deploy remote research methods to shed light on both the short- and potential long-term effects of Covid-19 across a range of issues. These include: 1) “Social distancing” and virtual social interaction, 2) Governance and democracy, 3) Public trust and (dis)information, 4) Social inequality and the pandemic’s disproportionate effects by race and ethnicity, 5) The lessons of past disasters, and responses to them, for the present, 6) The role of religious ideas, practices, and institutions in responding to the pandemic, 7) The workplace and labor markets, 8) Technology, surveillance, and ethics and 9) the uses of, and the limits to, modeling in responses to the pandemic’s effects and in scenario planning. The grants offer research support for up to six months toward research-related expenses. These include, but are not limited to, access to data sets, archives and relevant publications, costs related to conducting online research of various kinds, and research assistance. Awards will range from $2,000 to $5,000, with the possibility of slightly more support for collaborative projects of two or more researchers.","response grants thus support innovative research projects

Stevens Initiative Coronavirus Response Fund,Virtual Exchange,"The Stevens Initiative is providing resources to help education, exchange, and non-profit organizations in the United States and the Middle East and North Africa conduct virtual exchange programs to engage young people and educators affected by the pandemic. The Initiative views virtual exchange as programs that: use online technology to connect individuals and small groups between countries; are based on a curriculum or activity plan; involve qualified facilitators (such as educators or others); and involve sustained communication and collaboration synchronously (in real-time) or asynchronously over a period of time. The Initiative encourages proposals by consortia that include organizations with relevant and complementary experience, capacities, and networks. All organizations, including those that are not offered grants, are welcome and encouraged to participate in the Initiative’s virtual exchange programming training and mentorship sessions, which begin April 29.","north africa conduct virtual exchange programs

Strategies To Prevent (STOP) Spillover,Zoonotic Viruses,"Due date is June 01, 2020 and the closing time is 1:00 pm EST.
Through STOP Spillover, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) seeks to reduce the vulnerability of high-risk/low-capacity countries in Asia and Africa to (1) spillover of emerging zoonotic viruses from animal hosts (such as livestock or wildlife) to humans and (2) amplification and spread of these viruses once they have spilled over to humans. For the purposes of the STOP Spillover activity “wildlife” shall include terrestrial species that may act as a host or reservoir for the transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans, and does not include captive zoo animals, fish and aquatic species, insects, plants, or domesticated animals such as dogs or cats.","stop spillover activity “ wildlife ” shall include terrestrial species

DRL FY19 Countering Corruption amid COVID-19,Combatting Corruption,"The U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL) announces an open competition for organizations interested in submitting applications in support of the goal of combatting corruption arising in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries around the world are grappling with unprecedented challenges as they tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. While the first responsibility of every government is to care for its people, an effective response to a public health crisis like COVID-19 requires government transparency and accountability, the full participation of civil society, and access to information. Corruption in particular thrives during times of crisis and makes governments and the international community less able to respond swiftly and effectively.","public health crisis like covid

The COVID-19 Related Research Grants support education research projects that will contribute to understanding the rapid shifts in education in this time of crisis and change. We are especially interested in supporting two primary categories of projects. First, we are interested in supporting studies that aim to understand and disrupt the reproduction and deepening of educational inequality caused by the COVID-19 crisis. Second, we also recognize that in times of great disruption and change, there may be opportunities to remake and imagine anew forms of equitable education. Thus, we are also interested in research projects that are working to reimagine educational opportunities in these times.","19 related research grants support education research projects

Rapid Response to Novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) Impacts Across Food and Agricultural Systems,Food Supply,"See pages 72-75 of the RFA for the COVID-19 section. This Program Area Priority is due 06/04/2020.
The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the nation’s food and agricultural systems. Currently, data is needed to reliably guide decision-making that are supported by scientific evidence. This program area priority addresses the need to develop and deploy rapid, reliable, and readily adoptable strategies across the food and agriculture enterprise in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These strategies should mitigate urgent threats from the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) and ensure the availability of an accessible, safe, nutritious, and abundant food supply. Proposals addressing this priority can be local, regional or national in scope and should employ interdisciplinary teams with the capacity to address the range of problems faced by the entire food and agriculture enterprise, from production to consumption. Funded projects are expected to provide solutions to include tools, techniques, technologies, food supply logistics, innovations, and other practices that can be rapidly adopted by various end-users.","readily adoptable strategies across

The Department of State’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, Office of Export Control Cooperation (ISN/ECC) is pleased to announce a new funding opportunity through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).  Under this NOFO, ISN/ECC seeks proposals to advance U.S. foreign policy and national security priorities aimed at supporting initiatives that make decision-making structures and processes in fragile, conflict, or crisis-affected contexts more reflective of and responsive to the needs and perspectives of partner states. Initiatives should ensure strategic trade control systems meet international standards and by engaging on bilateral, regional and multilateral levels with foreign governments to aid in the establishment of independent capabilities to regulate transfers of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), WMD-related items, conventional arms, and related dual-use items, and to detect, interdict, investigate, and prosecute illicit transfers of such items.  As ISN/ECC operates in over 50 countries, this funding opportunity seeks to create regional and country-specific impactful and focused immediate, medium, and long-term rapid prevention and response capabilities to emerging biological threats such as COVID-19.","ensure strategic trade control systems meet international standards

A research opportunity is currently available with the Division of Plasma Protein Therapeutics (DPPT), in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (OTAT), at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) located in Silver Spring, Maryland. The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has sparked a global search for effective therapies and a vaccine. DPPT has a research opportunity for a recent graduate in computational biology /bioinformatics / computer science to be involved with a project related to COVID-19. The project focuses on using computational models to predict efficacy of novel drugs and biologics, including neutralizing antibodies, against SARS-CoV-2. The project also has a focus on vaccine design through sequence deoptimization. This will involve the use of existing bioinformatics pipelines and development of novel computational tools.","plasma protein therapeutics
