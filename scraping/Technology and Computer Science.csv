https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/prasanthi-govindarajan ","Maldonado, Altamirano, Govindarajan and Blomkalns are investigating three swab techniques used during COVID-19 testing: a self-collected nasal swab performed with the aid of an instruction sheet; a health care worker-collected nasal swab; and a health care worker-collected oropharyngeal swab. Should self-collected nasal swabs prove as effective as those collected by health care workers, patients may be able to safely and effectively collect specimens outside of health care settings."

https://profiles.stanford.edu/carlos-milla?tab=research-and-scholarship ","Milla and his team are evaluating whether improvements they’ve made in a lung function test can more successfully and safely identify subjects at high risk of severe COVID-19 disease, even when disease is in its early, asymptomatic stage. Standard tests involve inhaling deeply and quickly exhaling as much air as possible. The Milla lab’s improvements allow subjects to simply breathe passively for a few seconds through a mouthpiece. This not only makes the test feasible for sick subjects but also minimizes the generation of aerosols. "

In vitro and animal-model data suggest Lambda may also inhibit replication of respiratory viruses, such as the COVID-19 virus. The team plans to perform a phase 2 randomized controlled trial of Lambda among outpatients with mild COVID-19 to determine whether the drug reduces the duration of symptoms, viral shedding and the risk of hospitalization."

https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/russ-altman ","Altman and his group have used artificial intelligence to computationally predict six drugs that could inhibit TMPRSS2, a protein that plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Altman and his collaborators outside of Stanford Medicine plan to conduct experimental follow-up studies to explore the efficacy of two of the drugs in blocking SARS-CoV-2 from causing infection. While promising, the potential drugs are still part of a preliminary computational analysis and would be dangerous to use clinically at this time."

Jon Huibregtse,UT Austin,https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-LM-20-011.html,"Professor Dr. Huibregtse submitted a manuscript to Molecular Cell, showing that the SARS-CoV-
2/COVID-19 virus encodes a protease that counteracts the activity of the cellular
ISG15 anti-viral protein. This result establishes the viral protease (PLpro) as a drug
target for antiviral therapy. Further, the Mol. Cell paper proposes that a consequence
of PLpro de-ISGylase activity is the stimulation of a pro-inflammatory ""cytokine storm"".
COVID-19 patients die largely as a result of cytokine storms, and his results suggest a
clear route toward inhibiting the cytokine storm that is initiated as a result of PLpro
activity. Further, following submission of the Mol. Cell paper, he identified an FDA-
approved drug that inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protease. The molecule blocks its
ability to act on ISG15 conjugates and we have strong preliminary evidence that this
will also block pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. This is a key finding, as it
suggests that the off-label use of an approved drug may directly impact patients
during the current crisis, if deployed rapidly."
