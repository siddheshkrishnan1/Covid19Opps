Building COVID-19 testing capacity both locally and nationally,"Benjamin Pinsky, MD, PhD","Pinsky’s team is focused on building COVID-19 testing capacity, both locally and nationally. They are collaborating with other clinical laboratories to ensure these labs can meet the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 clinical testing. The group is also working with various collaborators to develop and evaluate novel methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as methods to assess immune protection and to predict the severity of disease.","assess immune protection

Validation of specimen self-collection vs. collection by health care worker for COVID-19 testing,"Yvonne Maldonado, MD; Jonathan Altamirano; Prasanthi Govindarajan, MD, and Andra Blomkalns, MD","Maldonado, Altamirano, Govindarajan and Blomkalns are investigating three swab techniques used during COVID-19 testing: a self-collected nasal swab performed with the aid of an instruction sheet; a health care worker-collected nasal swab; and a health care worker-collected oropharyngeal swab. Should self-collected nasal swabs prove as effective as those collected by health care workers, patients may be able to safely and effectively collect specimens outside of health care settings.","investigating three swab techniques used

Lung function in people infected with SARS-CoV-2,"Carlos Milla, MD","Milla and his team are evaluating whether improvements they’ve made in a lung function test can more successfully and safely identify subjects at high risk of severe COVID-19 disease, even when disease is in its early, asymptomatic stage. Standard tests involve inhaling deeply and quickly exhaling as much air as possible. The Milla lab’s improvements allow subjects to simply breathe passively for a few seconds through a mouthpiece. This not only makes the test feasible for sick subjects but also minimizes the generation of aerosols. ","standard tests involve inhaling deeply

Defining the therapeutic potential of host-targeted approaches for combating COVID-19,"Shirit Einav, MD","Einav’s lab is researching repurposed and novel anti-viral approaches targeting two cellular kinases that are an Achilles' heel of multiple unrelated RNA viruses. Their data show that a combination of two already-approved anti-cancer drugs that act against these kinases inhibits replication of multiple viruses in vitro and reduces mortality in mice infected with the dengue or Ebola viruses. The lab has also been developing more selective compounds that target these cellular kinases and have potent activity against multiple RNA viruses, including flaviviruses and coronaviruses, both in vitro and in human primary cells.","viral approaches targeting two cellular kinases

Using artificial intelligence to predict drugs that may inhibit COVID-19,"Russ Altman, MD, PhD, and other collaborators","Altman and his group have used artificial intelligence to computationally predict six drugs that could inhibit TMPRSS2, a protein that plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Altman and his collaborators outside of Stanford Medicine plan to conduct experimental follow-up studies to explore the efficacy of two of the drugs in blocking SARS-CoV-2 from causing infection. While promising, the potential drugs are still part of a preliminary computational analysis and would be dangerous to use clinically at this time.","computationally predict six drugs

Systems biological “multi-omics” analysis of immunity to COVID-19 infection,"Bali Pulendran, PhD",Pulendran is investigating the interaction between the human immune system and the SARS-CoV-2 virus through systems-biological methods. His group will use a “multi-omics” approach to probe the host immune system response to SARS-CoV-2 during asymptomatic and symptomatic phases of infection. Their goal is to determine why some people get more severe symptoms than others and to identify biomarkers that predict disease severity in vulnerable populations. His group will also study the immune mechanisms by which vaccines confer protection against SARS-CoV-2.,"host immune system response

Deep omics profiling to determine the genomic factors at play in disease severity,"Euan Ashley, MB ChB, DPhill; Victoria Parikh, MD; Matthew Wheeler, MD; Carlos Bustamante, PhD; and Manuel Rivas, DPhil","Ashley, Parikh and their team are sequencing genomic information from SARS-CoV-2 and human hosts to better understand the diversity of host responses to the virus. Their work aims to better elucidate genomic details underlying COVID-19 disease severity. To do so, the team will collect de-identified omic and clinical data for 1,000 Stanford patients who tested positive for COVID-19-, including hospitalized patients and patients who were in the intensive care unit.","better elucidate genomic details underlying covid

Multi-omics assessment of individuals infected with COVID-19,"Michael Snyder, PhD; Sam Yang, MD, FACEP; and Maya Kasowski, PhD","The Snyder group will collect biological samples from individuals ill with COVID-19 and those most at risk for the disease, observing and assessing levels of certain molecules involved in several biological pathways, including metabolism and immune function. The team will use this information to create “omics” profiles to look for potential molecular signatures of COVID-19 infection, as well as signs that an individual might have a strong adverse reaction to the virus.","create “ omics ” profiles

Role of antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease ,"Taia Wang, MD, PhD","Wang and her group are studying molecules that correlate with immunity against COVID-19. Their studies focus on defining a protective antibody response, and they will investigate whether antibodies have a role in determining the severity of COVID-19. The overarching goal of this work is to guide the development of vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","protective antibody response

Inflammatory bowel disease treatment in the time of COVID: Patient perceptions and decision-making ,"Cindy Kin, MD; Elizabeth Shelton; Kreeti Shankar; and Sarah Streett, MD","Kin and Streett are exploring how people with inflammatory bowel diseases, including people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis whose treatment frequently involves chronic immunosuppressive therapies, are affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The study aims to understand the primary concerns that patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have about their illnesses and treatments as they relate to the COVID-19 epidemic so that physicians and the health care team can effectively engage them in shared decision-making.","ulcerative colitis whose treatment frequently involves chronic immunosuppressive therapies

SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiovascular complications,"Sean Wu, MD;  Patricia Nguyen, MD;  Catherine Blish, MD, PhD, and Jan Carette, PhD",Wu and Nguyen are researching cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. The scientists are addressing the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection in heart muscle and vascular cells and the consequences of taking common drugs for high blood pressure. Their research employs muscle and vascular cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells to determine how these blood pressure drugs affect the virus’ ability to enter cells. ,"human induced pluripotent stem cells

Gastrointestinal manifestations in SARS-CoV-2,"George Cholankeril, MD; Alexander Podboy, MD; and Aijaz Ahmed, MD","Cholankeril, Podboy and Ahmed aim to characterize the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly one-third of patients in their study had gastrointestinal symptoms while infected with SARS-CoV-2. The team also saw mild elevations in liver enzymes in some patients, which may correlate with a need for a higher level of care. The group is continuing to investigate if gastrointestinal symptoms and liver enzyme abnormalities at presentation could be associated with increased severity of illness, requiring an escalation of care or higher rate of health care utilization.","team also saw mild elevations

Rates of co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens,"David Kim, MD, PhD; James Quinn, MD; Benjamin Pinsky, MD, PhD; Nigam Shah, PhD; and Ian Brown, MD","The scientists published a research letter that reports on how often patients infected with the coronavirus in Northern California are co-infected with other respiratory pathogens. Results of their analysis suggest higher rates of co-infection than previously reported, with no significant difference in rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with and without other pathogens. The study indicates that the presence of a non–SARS-CoV-2 pathogen does not provide reassurance that a patient isn’t also infected with SARS-CoV-2.","analysis suggest higher rates
